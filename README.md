# FizzBuzz in Ruby
FizzBuzz is a simply game that has gained in popularity as a programming assignment to weed out non-programmers during job interviews.
Created 100% in Ruby (with the use of lazy enumerator).

Rules:
For numbers 1 through (usually) 100,

- if the number is divisible by 3 print Fizz;
- if the number is divisible by 5 print Buzz;
- if the number is divisible by 3 and 5 (15) print FizzBuzz;
- else, print the number.
